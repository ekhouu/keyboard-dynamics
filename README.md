# keyboard-dynamics

This is an experiment in typing "fingerprints." Basically, what does your typing style say about you?

1. How does layout affect keyboard dynamics? Is it possible to identify the same user across layouts? (like... Shazam fingerprinting? is a good comparison for that)
2. How well does typing style predict demographic characteristics of the typist? Also, is NLP/other language-driven DL able to predict things like first language based on typing patterns?
3. Can we glean any information about the physical keyboard from just the user's typing dynamics, even if typing style varies a lot across people?

Currently using the [KeyRecs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340923006091?via%3Dihub) dataset for quick prototyping, but I plan to switch to a larger one, and eventually collect my own data so I can have more control over what is actually included in the datasets.
